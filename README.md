# FreeCell
This is a console-based free cell game using data structures I created such as my own Array structure, 
Doubly-Linked list structure, and Stack structures. It also contains a Card class, Deck of cards class,
and Exception class.

The game begins by shuffling the deck and randomly populating the board for a new game.
The start of a new game can be seen below:

The game contains a free cell section which is used to temporarily hold cards, a home section which is where the
cards will (hopefully) end up if the game goes well, and a board section where the rest of the deck still in play
resides.

It is a console-based game with no graphics, so it can only be controlled with user input through stdin, not with a mouse.
