# FreeCell
This is a console-based free cell game using data structures I created such as my own Array structure, 
Doubly-Linked list structure, and Stack structures. I also contains a Card class and Deck of cards class.

It begins by shuffling the deck and randomly populating the board for a new game.

The game contains a free cell section, a home section, and a board section. And it can be controlled with user input,
however not with a mouse.
